# Beer world projects

*Beer world* is a small web application listing beers developed under different frameworks.
Each project are developed with a tutorial. May this tutorial help somebody, I would be glad
but the primary purpose is for myself to fix my short memory. Beer consumption is not involved
regarding my poor brain. The mindset of the _beer world_ is to provide a real life application
meaning such web applications can be tested and deployed.

Project purposes are:

- _Learning_: how to code
- _Benchmarking_: by actually coding
- _Beering_: Learning about beers is on my todo list for too long

## Repository

Because it aims at mimicing real life, each project has its dedicated repository. Main reason
is probably it makes CI / CD easier.

## Features

Features are detailed in this repository issues. Overview is as follow:

- [A] Basic beer CRUD
- [B] Beer properties
- [C] Testing
- [D] Deployment
