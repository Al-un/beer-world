# Beer world projects

_Beer world_ is a small web application listing beers developed under different frameworks.
Each project are developed with a tutorial. May this tutorial help somebody, I would be glad
but the primary purpose is for myself to fix my short memory. Beer consumption is not involved
regarding my poor brain. The mindset of the _beer world_ is to provide a real life application
meaning such web applications can be tested and deployed.

Project purposes are:

- _Learning_: how to code
- _Benchmarking_: by actually coding
- _Beering_: Learning about beers is on my todo list for too long

## Repository

Because it aims at mimicing real life, each project has its dedicated repository. Main reason
is probably it makes CI / CD easier.

Projects are split in three types:

- Full stack: uses a single stack / technology to power the web application from database connection
  to web views
- API: uses a stack / technology to provide a REST API. Need to be coupled with a front-end
- Front-end: uses a stack / technology as web views but need an API to handle data

## Features

Features are detailed in this repository issues. Overview is as follow:

- [A] Basic beer CRUD
- [B] Beer properties
- [C] Testing
- [D] Deployment
