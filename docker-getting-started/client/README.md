# Docker getting started: Client

As our API has only one endpoint, the Client is a dead simple Vue.js application:

- Vue CLI is used to bootstrap the application with a minimal configuration
- The Home page, and only page, will load the beers from the API and display the different name in a grid

In a nutshell, nothing worthy to mention here :)
